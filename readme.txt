== History ==

WordPress, from the earliest days, included some way to bring in snippets from other websites for you to post on your own.

The original "Press It" was removed from WordPress 2.5 and a new "Press This" added in 2.6. It existed pretty much unchanged until WordPress 4.2, which completely refreshed Press This.

In WordPress 4.9, Press This was spun out to a "canonical plugin" -- an official plugin from WordPress.org so sites who wanted to use it could, but streamline more niche functionality out of Core. This was previously done with the Importers.
